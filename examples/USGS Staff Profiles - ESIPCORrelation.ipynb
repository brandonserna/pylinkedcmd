    "Connecting terms used for describing staff expertise to the USGS Thesaurus gives us a certain number of more well developed concepts beyond simple keywords that have definitions, links to other related concepts, and some work toward settling on accepted words and phrasing. However, that vocabulary source is also completely developed within the intramural context of the USGS. On the one hand, that can be a benefit, because we are coming at this from the standpoint of our own corporate system of knowledge and the concepts there should conceivably align reasonably well with other information sources we may be working from. However, as we've explored so far, there are a lot of terms our staff are using to describe their expertise that are not found in the USGS Thesaurus today. And, on the whole, there are other formalized knowledge systems in various states of maturity beyond our borders that likely have a ton of information that we can leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility for continuous mining is the ESIP Community Ontology Repository, a resource established and maintained by the quite active ESIP semantic technologies community that is the logical home for the SWEET ontology, specifically, and other ontology sources that the community as a whole provides some stewardship over or that are otherwise interesting for use. As an experiment, I'm attempting a similar exercise on semantic evaluation of the subset of USGS staff expertise assertions for CDI members pulled from their profile pages, this time against ontology sources in the ESIP COR. Notionally, I should be able to logically connect USGS staff to a knowledge network represented in one or more of those ontologies and then exploit that linkage to both flesh out the characterization of our staff and go after additional sources of information with a broader base of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook starts down that path, but I'm quickly running up against a couple of challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ESIP COR as it stands does not provide anything like a performant platform for wide open discovery and exploration. SPARQL queries at a certain level of specificity are inherently cumbersome, and trying to look for every triple anywhere with a mention of a certain term is quite slow. I'm going to have to work through what's actually available from the ESIP COR and come up with a more directed search pattern if I'm going to establish anything meaningful.\n",
    "* There are a lot of different types of terms and concepts represented in even the relatively small number of unique terms (~250) represented in the quite small number of CDI members with active staff profiles (<60). Some concepts there are complete shorthand, lacking anything like enough specifity to even know what type of concept they might represent (e.g., \"agile\" and \"backcountry\"). Someone smarter than me could possibly take a combined set of terms for a given person through some kind of text analysis routine and add some useful context to terms to direct concept linkage searches more efficiently. I don't know how to do that yet and will need to simply ignore results based on some pattern for now."

With all the noted limitations and issues, this basic regex-based search on terms does yield some potentially interesting results. Connections to GCMD afforded by its registry with the ESIP COR could yield hints at particular scientific instruments or platforms where a method/technique that someone claims as expertise could be involved. Having this linkage might mean another bit of evidence in connecting dots to what a given person has produced, information sources they are involved in, organizations with which they are affiliated, or other useful connections. I may also be able to pull additional sources of definition and synonymous or complementary terms that can be used to flesh out a directional search from the expertise concepts.

I want to be able to write reasoners that use a preponderance of evidence from the characteristics of things that my requirement demands to determine what things I can use in what circumstances. I want things that are well referenced, potentially from a suite of trusted sources but more importantly with a working, configurable definition of what constitutes trustworthiness, and well documented as to provenance. However, keep running up against the need to configure some set of hard coded lists of codes/identifiers that I trust in a particular way. That's totally not scalable or sustainable! I'm also struggling through just how many \"subqueries\" I need to run, often with the need to parse identifiers and add resolvers (and sometimes with a priori knowledge necessary) and usually involving something other than the simplicity of content resolution, in order go track down all those details about any given concept. There's got to be a better way to wade through this stuff that I'm just not smart enough to know yet."

Sound signals sent from the\\nmoving ship bounce back to receivers aboard the ship. This\\nprovides a profile of water movement relative to the\\nship-precise modern navigation, allowing the ship\\'s motion to be\\nsubtracted from the data. These devices are also used on\\nmoorings and profilers and, along with acoustic backscattering,\\nmeasure animal biomass. Particles in the path of the sound\\nwaves, mostly plankton, reflect a small part of the sound energy\\nback toward receivers, allowing researchers to make remote\\nestimates of the sizes and numbers of animals present in the\\nwater column.  Before the 1970\\'s, the most technologically\\nadvanced instrument used to measure water velocity was known as\\na Doppler speed log. This evolved into the first commercial\\nADCP, produced in the mid-1970\\'s, which used averaging. Later in\\nthe 1970\\'s, the first vessel-mounted ADCP was developed to\\nmeasure water velocity more accurately and to allow measurement\\nin range cells over a depth profile.\\n\\nAs instruments evolved, so did new techniques in Doppler signal\\nprocessing. Initially, Doppler speed logs used simple analog\\nsignal processing methods, which are still used in some\\ncommercial speed logs today. However, the first ADCPs\\nincorporated analog-to-digital signal conversion over a narrow\\ncommunication bandwidth. Around 1990, this technique was\\ndeveloped into broadband signal processing. Since then,\\nbroadband ADCPs have been able to generate very accurate,\\nreal-time velocity measurements.\\n\\nAdditional information available at\\n\"http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=819\"\\n'}},\n",

The overall objective is to provide scene-specific spot imagery in high resolution to the Indian Armed Forces - which is in the process of establishing an Aerospace Command.\\n\\nThe spacecraft and its payload, built by ISRO, is practically an identical copy of the CartoSat-2 spacecraft of ISRO. It features a lightweight and compact bus structure using the BMU (Bus Management Unit) for integrated bus functions (of the AOCS, TT&C, etc.). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using high torque reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, and hydrazine thrusters. Attitude sensing is provided by a high performance star sensor and by an improved IRU (Inertial Reference Unit). The satellite is very agile providing a body-pointing capability in along-track and cross-track of up to ±45º (this supports a revisit capability of certain target regions within 4 days). Also use of the SPS (Satellite Positioning System), an 8-channel GPS receiver (C/A code) on-board for the provision of instantaneous state vectors (state vector using pseudo range and range rate measurements) for the spacecraft.\\n\\nThe fixed solar arrays (triple-junction solar cells) provide a power of 900 W when pointed toward the sun; two NiCd batteries of 18 Ah capacity are being used for ecliptic phase bridging.\\n\\nCartoSat-2A has a launch mass of 690 kg and a design life of 5 years. \\n\\nLaunch: The launch of CartoSat-2A took place on April 28, 2008 on a PSLV launcher. The launch was conducted from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota space station in southern India. Next to the primary payload of CartoSat-2A, the PSLV-C9 vehicle successfully launched the IMS-1 (Indian Microsatellite-1) of 83 kg and eight nanosatellites for international customers.\\n\\nSensor complement:\\n\\nPAN Camera (Panchromatic Camera). The objective is to provide imagery for cartographic applications. The optical system is designed with two mirror Ritchey-Chretien on-axis obscured reflective telescope system with a concave hyperboloidal primary mirror and convex hyperboloid secondary mirrors and the field correcting relay optics. The mirrors are made of special Zerodur glass and are light-weighted to about 60% as in CartoSat-1 series. The mirrors are mounted inside the telescope cylinder made of CFRP with special MFDs (Mirror Fixation Devices) and the whole telescope assembly is mounted to the spacecraft structure through a special suspension arrangement. The optical system is designed to provide < 1 m resolution across track. The along track GSD of < 1 m is achieved by apparent velocity reduction by a factor of 2.5.\\n\\nThe spacecraft can be suitably biased to provide various modes of imaging:\\n\\n1) Continuous strip monoscopic mode\\n\\n2) Spot scene imaging (strips on either side of the ground track can be imaged)\\n\\n3) Paint brush mode of imaging. This mode is used to increase the total swath. Both roll tilt and pitch tilt is employed.\\n\\nThe PAN Camera is a nadir-pointing pushbroom CCD instrument (detector line array of 12, 288 pixels), observing in the visible spectral range of 0.5-0.85 µm with a GSD (Ground Sample Distance) of < 1 m, and a swath width of 9.6 km at nadir. \\n\\nThe spacecraft is being monitored and controlled from the ISRO mission control center in Bangalore, India using the ISTRAC network of stations at Bangalore, Lucknow, Mauritius, Bearslake in Russia, Biak in Indonesia and Svalbard in Norway.\\n\\n\\nGroup: Platform_Details\\n   Entry_ID: CARTOSAT-2A\\n   Group: Platform_Identification\\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\\n      Short_Name: CARTOSAT-2A\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\\n      Short_Name: PAN\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Orbit\\n      Orbit_Altitude: 635 km\\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.94 degrees \\n      Period: 97.4 minutes\\n      Repeat_Cycle: 4 days\\n      Perigee: 628.7 km\\n      Apogee: 653.2 km\\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\\n   End_Group\\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=10000443\\n   Online_Resource: http://www.isro.org/pslv-c9/cartosat2a.htm\\n   Sample_Image: http://directory.eoportal.org/presentations/7336/CartoSat2A_Auto2.jpeg\\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\\n      Launch_Date: 2008-04-28\\n      Launch_Site: Sriharikota Island, India\\n      Design_Life: 5 YEARS\\n      Primary_Sponsor: Ministry of Defense of the Government of India\\n   End_Group\\nEnd_Group\\n\"}},\n",

Other consortium members are Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) designed and Infoterra.\\n\\nThe satellite is designed to return its data directly to a mobile ground station immediately after collecting an image, allowing far more timely delivery of the information which it collects than standard satellites. The system is specifically designed to meet operational timescales, whether for disaster relief, news-gathering, or other applications where speed of response is vital.\\n\\nTopSat received the Aviation and Space Grand Award – the top award for aerospace technology, from Popular Science, the best selling science and technology magazine in the world. The magazine’s editors concluded that TopSat is an innovation that has the potential to change satellite and space reconnaissance technology.\\n\\nTopSat weighs just 120 kg, but carries an optical camera capable of delivering panchromatic images with a spatial resolution at nadir of 2.8 metres covering a 17x17 km area, and simultaneous three-band multi-spectral images, (red, green, blue), with a resolution of 5.6 metres. This is thought to represent the best resolution per mass of any satellite launched to date. This camera is integrated with an agile micro-satellite platform to permit pitch compensation manoeuvres, allowing imaging of low illumination scenes.\\n\\nTopSat has been in operation since its launch from Plesetsk in Russia on 27th October 2005. The satellite can be reprogrammed in orbit, and the consortium is exploiting this to enhance its performance. In addition to actively pursuing experiments for the MOD and BNSC, the consortium is also seeking new applications to which the technology can be applied. In the future, a constellation of three or four TopSat satellites could image almost any point on the Earth at least once a day, further opening up the potential for quick response imagery which is extremely cost effective to deliver.\\n\\n[Information from QinetiQ Ltd.]\\n\\n\\nGroup: Platform_Details\\n   Entry_ID: TOPSAT\\n   Group: Platform_Identification\\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\\n      Short_Name: TOPSAT\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Orbit\\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.1\\n      Period: 98.6\\n      Repeat_Cycle: 4\\n      Perigee: 688.4\\n      Apogee: 714\\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\\n   End_Group\\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-18\\n   Online_Resource: http://www.qinetiq.com/home/defence/defence_solutions/space/topsat.html\\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=5135\\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\\n      Launch_Date: 2005-10-27\\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\\n      Primary_Sponsor: QinetiQ Ltd.\\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

In January 2006, the commercial imaging company GeoEye was formed, made up of former Orbimage of Dulles VA, and of former Space Imaging of Thornton, CO (Orbimage acquired Space Imaging in 2005 and gave the merged company the new name of GeoEye). The newly formed GeoEye company is the world's largest commercial satellite imagery provider.\\n\\nOn Sept. 30, 2004, OrbImage was awarded a NextView vendor contract of NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). The contract, referred to as NextView OrbImage, provides long-term revenue commitments as well as capital for the development of OrbView-5. NGA's NextView program is designed to give US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging.\\n\\nGeoEye's principal partners for the development and launch of the GeoEye-1 satellite include General Dynamics (formerly Spectrum Astro), ITT Industries (imager), and Boeing Launch Services. GeoEye's partners for the ground segment include IBM and MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates) of Richmond, BC, Canada.\\n\\nhe GeoEye-1 spacecraft is being designed and developed at General Dynamics/C4 Systems of Gilbert, AZ (formerly Spectrum Astro) as prime contractor. The contract was award in Dec. 2004. The spacecraft design is based on the SA-200HP standard modular bus (of Coriolis and SWIFT heritage). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized with a sophisticated attitude control system to provide a highly stable, while also highly agile imaging platform.\\n\\nA body-pointing capability of up to ± 60º is being provided, made possible by enhanced reaction wheels (low jitter). The image geolocation accuracy is ≤ 3 m. The spacecraft mass is 1955 kg (bus mass = 1260 kg), the S/C design is fully redundant with an operational life of 7 years (the expected life is 10 years).\\n\\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 684 km, inclination = 98º, period = 98 minutes, local equatorial crossing at 10:30 hours, effective revisit time capability ≤ 3 days.\\n\\nLaunch: A launch of GeoEye-1 is scheduled for August 2008 on a Delta-2 (7420-10) vehicle from VAFB, CA. The launch provider is ULA (United Launch Alliance). The launch delay from the fall of 2007 is due to a launch congestion at VAFB.\\n\\nRF communications: The source data are being stored on solid-state onboard recorders of 1.2 Tbit capacity. The downlink of imagery in X-band at 740 Mbit/s (or at 150 Mbit/s), the TT&C data are in S-band. The S/C is being operated from the command and control facility at GeoEye headquarters in Dulles, VA, along with an imagery acquisition station. Three other acquisition stations will be operated or leased by GeoEye in Barrow, AK, Tromsø, Norway and Troll, Antarctica (the TrollSat station is located at 72º S and 2º E). The latter two stations are being leased from KSAT (Kongsberg Satellite Services) of Tromsø, Norway.\\nA total of four stations are needed to handle primary data reception due to the large volume of data that will be captured by the satellite. In addition, GeoEye will continue to support a network of receiving stations owned and operated by local business partners, referred to as Regional Affiliates and Regional Distributors.\\n\\nGround segment: GeoEye has built a fully integrated receiving, processing, and distribution network for delivering high-quality imagery products to customers around the world.\\n\\nIn late 2006, GeoEye purchased high-bandwidth, high-performance compute technology from SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.). Four SGI Altix systems were installed at the Dulles (VA) ground station for data processing, distribution, and archiving services.\\n\\nSensor complement: (GIS)\\n\\nThe requirements of GeoEye-1 call for panchromatic imagery with a resolution of 0.41 m and multispectral imagery with a resolution of 1.64 m.

In January 2007, the GeoEye-1 imager system was delivered to General Dynamics for integration into the spacecraft.\\n\\nGIS (GeoEye Imager System). GIS is a pushbroom imaging system whose basic elements are the optics subsystem (telescope assembly), the focal plane assembly (CCD detector), and the digital electronics subsystem. The optics subsystem employs a TMA (Three Mirror Anastigmatic) telescope design with a primary mirror aperture of 1.1 m in diameter. Three mirrors are used to image and focus the light, and two additional mirrors to direct the image to the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The telescope is designed to give a near-perfect (diffraction limited) image to the FPA and to convert the analog pixels into digitized signals.\\n\\nThe FPA consists of an array of CCD detectors with 8 µm pixel size for PAN and 32 µm pixel size for multispectral imagery. ITT has included an outer barrel and door assembly to help protect the telescope and maintain its thermal environment.\\n\\n\\nGroup: Platform_Details\\n   Entry_ID: GEOEYE-1\\n   Group: Platform_Identification\\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\\n      Short_Name: GEOEYE-1\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\\n      Short_Name: ORBVIEW-5\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Orbit\\n      Orbit_Altitude: 684 km\\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98 degrees \\n      Equator_Crossing: 10:30 AM\\n      Period: 98 minutes\\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3 days\\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\\n   End_Group\\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\\n   Online_Resource: http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/about/fact_sheet.aspx\\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=13708\\n   Sample_Image: http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/assets/images/about/satellite.gif\\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\\n      Launch_Date: 2008-08-22\\n      Design_Life: 10 YEARS\\n      Primary_Sponsor: US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\\n   End_Group\\nEnd_Group\\n\"}},\n",

The contract award was made within NGA's NextView program, designed to give the US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging. The WorldView mission is intended to provide imaging services to NGA as well as to the commercial customer base of DigitalGlobe.\\n\\nSpacecraft:\\n\\nBATC (Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation) of Boulder, CO, is the prime contractor and integrator of the spacecraft, providing the S/C bus (Ball Commercial Platform BCP-5000) and a WorldView-60 camera. A new feature of the WorldView spacecraft are CMG (Control Moment Gyroscopes) actuators for precise and highly responsive pointing control. The BCP-5000 bus provides increased power, stability, agility, data storage and transmission (over the BCP-2000 bus) as the demand for Earth remote-sensing information becomes more comprehensive. \\n\\nThe S/C is 3-axis stabilized. The ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) employs star trackers, IRU (Inertial Reference Unit) and GPS for attitude sensing, and CMGs as actuators. A S/C body-pointing range of ±40º about nadir is provided corresponding to a FOR (Field of Regard) of 775 km in cross-track. An instantaneous pointing accuracy of ≤ 500 m is provided at any start and stop of an imaging sequence. On the ground, the geolocation accuracy of the imagery is 5.8 to 7.6 m without GPCs (Ground Control Points) and 2 m with GPCs (3σ).

(IAI/MBT). The deployed S/C structure is 2.3 m high and 4.0 m wide. The S/C is is 3-axis stabilized and the light/rigid design of the EROS satellite family allows for a great degree of platform agility. The spacecraft is very agile, a body-pointing capability of ±45º from nadir is provided in all directions, supporting the daily data acquisition plan. The S/C attitude is sensed and controlled as done with EROS-A. In addition, there is a star sensor for the B satellite series. The nominal S/C design life is six years.\\n\\nThe nominal S/C launch mass is ~290 kg; however, additional onboard fuel (up to 60 kg) is sufficient for S/C operations of up to 10 years.

The instrument uses also a Cassegrain telescope with an aperture of 50 cm in diameter and a focal length of 5 m (folded optics). FOV = 1.5º. The PIC-2 instrument is rigidly mounted to the S/C structure looking into the nadir direction, thus permitting a body-pointing observation scheme. \\n\\nhe CCD pushbroom detector array provides 10,000 pixels per line and a total of 96 lines for selectable TDI observation support. Pushbroom scanning is provided for panchromatic imagery only in the spectral range of 0.5 - 0.9 μm. The ground sampling distance (GSD) is 0.70 m, the swath width is 7 km at nadir.

The first satellite was named \"Tiung\" after a beautiful small singing bird in Malaysia. Astronautic Technology Sdn. Bhd. (ATSB) is a research and development organization, which was formed in 1995 by the government of Malaysia. \\n\\nThe TiungSat-1 specific applications are in the following fields:\\n\\n* Collection of imagery for environmental and meteorological use\\n* Digital S&F (Store & Forward) communications\\n* Technology demonstration\\n* Space science\\n* Amateur radio access\\n\\nSpacecraft:\\n\\nThe TiungSat-1 S/C structure comprises eleven module trays used to house the electronics for the bus and payload systems. The box-like spacecraft has a size of 690 mm x 360 mm x 360 mm; it is three-axis stabilized using a gravity-gradient boom (6 m boom with tip mass), two 3-axis magnetorquers, and a momentum wheel. Attitude is sensed by two 3-axis magnetometers and by two-axis analog sun sensors. In addition, there are UED (Underneath Earth Detector) and SOD (Sun Overhead Detector). The pointing knowledge is in roll and pitch and in yaw (3 sigma values). The S/C power is 35 W per panel, provided by four surface-mounted GaAs solar panels and by a 10-cell NiCd battery (7 Ah). The power subsystem provides regulated voltage supplies at +5V and 10V along with an unregulated supply which fluctuates between 12-14 V. Autonomous functions, safe modes and data are handled by two OBCs (On-Board Computer), OBC-186 and OBC-386. Onboard data handling via a CAN (Controller Area Network) between platform and payloads. The onboard data storage capacity is 1 Gbit. The S/C mass is 50 kg (platform = 35 kg, payload = 15 kg). The nominal design life is three years.\\n\\nRF communications: TiungSat uses conventional AMSAT frequencies (Malaysian Oscar-46), thereby giving amateur radio operators access to its data (imagery and communication capabilities). The microsatellite features an AX.25 protocol store-and-forward PACSAT protocol suite communications system. The uplink is in VHF-band with a data rate of 9.6 kbit/s; three receivers are used: Rx1 operates at 144.46 MHz, Rx2 and Rx3 operate at 145.86 145.925 MHz, selectable. The downlink is dual-redundant in UHF-band (435 to 438 MHz range with 437.300, 437.325, 437.350, 437.375 MHz, selectable) with data rates of 9.6, and 38.4 kbit/s (experimentally at 76.8 kit/s). An error-protected digital packet communications protocol is used. All spacecraft operations are performed at ATSB in Kuala Lumpur.\\n\\nTiungSat-1 was launched Sept. 26, 2000 on a Dnepr-1 vehicle along with other satellites (the other payloads were: SaudiSat-1A/-1B of SISR (Saudi Institute for Space Research), UniSat of the University of Rome, and MegSat-1 of the MegSat Space Division of \"Gruppo Meggiorin,\" Bresia, Italy) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.\\n\\nOrbit: Circular orbit, altitude = 650 km, inclination = 64, period = 97 minutes.\\n\\nSpacecraft operations are carried out at ATSB\\'s Mission Control Station located at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor. The satellite has also been used in a number of educational activities ranging from the physical sciences to the humanities.\\n\\nOperational status of TiungSat-1 as of 2004: The payload was fully operational well beyond its design life of three years. However, since Jan. 2004, the payload is only being operated intermittently to reduce the power consumption of the battery.\\n\\nSensor/experiment complement (MSEIS, MEIS, S&F, CEDEX):\\n\\nMSEIS (Multi-Spectral Earth Imaging System). MSEIS is a NAC (Narrow Angle Camera), a multispectral system of three cameras (green, red and near-infrared) in parallel, each with a 75 mm focal length optic and 100 mm aperture diameter. The NAC system provides a 78 m ground spatial resolution in three spectral bands: 510-590 nm, 610-690 nm and 810-890 nm (green, red, and near infrared). A two-dimensional CCD staring array detector with 1024 x 1024 pixels is used providing snapshot imagery of scene size 78 km x 78 km. Up to four contiguous images can be collected along the flight path. The data are digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels).\\n\\nMEIS (Metrological Earth Imaging System). MEIS is a single-band WAC (Wide Angle Camera) system with 6.5 mm focal length optics. It provides NIR imagery (810-890 nm) with a 900 m spatial resolution. The CCD area array detector has a size of 1024 x 1024 elements (pixels) for snapshot observations. Data are quantized to 8 bits radiometric resolution. An image has the size of 900 km x 900 km. The data is being used for meteorological applications.\\n\\nS&F (Digital Store & Forward Communications). The subsystem provides global, frequency-agile, communications for any form of digitized data: e-mail, voice-mail, scientific data exchange, fax, imagery, or even Internet mail for remote regions. The low cost and direct access offered by the TiungSat-1 microsatellite in orbit also makes it ideal for use by scientists, engineers and students based in institutes, universities and even schools throughout the world. - DSPE (Digital Signal Processing Experiment). The DSPE consists of a TM320C31 low power DSP suitable for special or general purpose signal processing tasks on LEO satellites. The VHF scanner operates in the 140-150 MHz range. A built-in FSK decoder is used. The system is capable to detect signals from a pre-set signal strength threshold within selected bar. DSP can be used for processing audio transmission for rebroadcast.\\n\\nCEDEX (Cosmic Ray Energy Deposition Experiment). The objective of CEDEX is to characterize the TiungSat-1 orbit radiation environment in terms of the observed particle LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectrum at the spacecraft. The primary sensor consists of a 30mm x 30mm PIN diode detector 300 microns in depth, housed in a separate screened aluminium unit mounted on the CEDEX module box (three area PIN-diode detectors are mounted in a \"telescopic\" arrangement; hence, information pertaining to directions of the energy particles detected can be derived.). This is connected to a charge amplifier and a pulse-shaping circuit which, in turn, are connected to an event-driven, hardware-logic controlled pulse-height multi-channel analyzer. CEDEX is controlled autonomously by a CAN-microcontroller with its own data-storage RAM and built-in data-compression software. This sends data to an internal CAN-controller which formats and sends them on to the primary OBC via the spacecraft\\'s CAN (Controlled Area Network) bus. CEDEX is a multichannel analyzer with 512 channels and a 0.5 pC (picocoulomb) charge resolution. The instrument charge range is between 0.2 -24 pC, equivalent to a normal incidence particle LET range of about 60 - 7500 MeV cm2 g-1 (200,000 particles/s).\\n\\nThe CEDEX data obtained are comparable directly with such instruments as CREDO-II flown on STRV-1c (launch Nov. 16, 2000) and CRE (Cosmic Ray Experiment) flown on KitSat-1 (launch Aug. 10, 1992) and PoSat-1 (launch Sept. 26, 1993).\\n\\nExperimental Microsatellite GPS, an SSTL/ESA collaboration. An advanced 12-channel GPS receiver with two GPS patch antennas is installed for several objectives: 1) onboard generation of Keplerian orbital elements (NORAD experiment, this was first performed on PoSat), 2) onboard navigation, attitude, and timing services, and 3) refractive sounding of the ionosphere. The instrument is primarily used for orbit and position determination and for precise onboard timing services. In parallel, the instrument is also employed for refractive ionospheric monitoring. The TEC (Total Electron Content) occultation observations of the instrument provide slant range measurements which can be converted into vertical profiles. \\n\\nInformation provided by:  http://www.eoPortal.org\\n\\n\\nGroup: Platform_Details\\n   Entry_ID: TIUNGSAT-1\\n   Group: Platform_Identification\\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\\n      Short_Name: TIUNGSAT-1\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\\n      Short_Name: MySat-1\\n      Short_Name: Oscar-46\\n      Short_Name: MO-46\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\\n   End_Group\\n   Group: Orbit\\n      Orbit_Altitude: 650\\n      Orbit_Inclination: 64.6\\n      Period: 97.1\\n      Perigee: 605.3\\n      Apogee: 647\\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\\n   End_Group\\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-19\\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=7470\\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sstl.co.uk/\\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\\n      Launch_Date: 2000-09-26\\n      Launch_Site: Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Russia\\n      Primary_Sponsor: Malaysia\\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool.'}},\n",

Data gathered by the OAST-2\\nexperiments could lead to satellites and spacecraft that are\\ncheaper, more reliable and able to operate more efficiently.\\n\\nSTS-62 will help scientists calibrate sensitive ozone- detecting\\ninstruments with the sixth flight of the Shuttle Solar\\nBackscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) Instrument. This highly\\ncalibrated tool is used to check data from ozone-measuring\\ninstruments on free-flying satellites -- NASA\\'s Total Ozone\\nMapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Upper Atmosphere Research\\nSatellite (UARS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\\nAdministration NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 satellites.\\n\\nThe Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) experiments and the Commercial\\nProtein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiments aboard Columbia will\\nhelp scientists understand the growth of crystals to study the\\ncomplex molecular structures of important proteins.

MODE investigates how the microgravity\\nof space flight influences the behavior of large space\\nstructures. The MODE test article can be configured in different\\nshapes typical of space structural forms-- the truss of a space\\nstation, for example -- to help engineers develop and verify an\\nanalytical modeling capability for predicting the linear and\\nnonlinear modal characteristics of space structures in a\\nmicrogravity environment.

Sound signals sent from the\\nmoving ship bounce back to receivers aboard the ship.

These devices are also used on\\nmoorings and profilers and, along with acoustic backscattering,\\nmeasure animal biomass. Particles in the path of the sound\\nwaves, mostly plankton, reflect a small part of the sound energy\\nback toward receivers, allowing researchers to make remote\\nestimates of the sizes and numbers of animals present in the\\nwater column.  Before the 1970\\'s, the most technologically\\nadvanced instrument used to measure water velocity was known as\\na Doppler speed log. This evolved into the first commercial\\nADCP, produced in the mid-1970\\'s, which used averaging. Later in\\nthe 1970\\'s, the first vessel-mounted ADCP was developed to\\nmeasure water velocity more accurately and to allow measurement\\nin range cells over a depth profile.\\n\\nAs instruments evolved, so did new techniques in Doppler signal\\nprocessing. Initially, Doppler speed logs used simple analog\\nsignal processing methods, which are still used in some\\ncommercial speed logs today. However, the first ADCPs\\nincorporated analog-to-digital signal conversion over a narrow\\ncommunication bandwidth. Around 1990, this technique was\\ndeveloped into broadband signal processing.

These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool.'}},\n",
