    "This notebook explores the dynamic of querying a system we are calling iSAID (Integrated Science Assessment Information Database) for information about people. Functionality is built into the [pylinkedcmd](https://github.com/skybristol/pylinkedcmd) package in the Isaid class. The functions shown here work against an experimental information cache exposed via a GraphQL end point that is accessible through functions in this codebase. The database contains cached information about all USGS staff from the following locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ScienceBase Directory\n",
    "* USGS Pubs Warehouse\n",
    "* USGS Profile Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from these sources is synthesized to generate the start to an automated research record for individual staff. The ScienceBase Directory is used as the most complete and reasonable access point for USGS staff records. Processes are run against Pubs Warehouse metadata to optimize data for analyzing co-author connections and associated organizational affiliations. Information is scraped from USGS Profile Pages into a data structure for use because there is currently no API or some type of programmatic access to those sources."

    "I'll eventually build a better mechanism for interacting with these data. In the near term, if you want to look for personnel records from a specific organization, you can pick something from the output list of organizations and put it into the criteria. The get_people() function will actually respond to search criteria on anything in the database, so you can probably figure out how to run lots of interesting searches with just a little sleuthing."
