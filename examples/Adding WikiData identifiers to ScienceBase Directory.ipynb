    "The [ScienceBase Directory](https://www.sciencebase.gov/directory) is a system we set up a long time ago as part of the overall ScienceBase work to house a directory of people and organizations important in documenting data for items in ScienceBase. It was our own 'invention' in USGS, and we should arguably replace it at some point with a better tool. It is part of USGS Corporate Master Data and provides a central point of cleaning up some overall messiness in how we keep track of people who work for USGS over time and people from other organizations who we partner with in our work. It is also how we try to keep up with the even messier issue of changing organizational units in our own institution, in neighboring instititions within the Department of the Interior, and with other partner organizations. There are background synchronization processes that bring together and make some sense of basic personnel information from our corporate authentication mechanism as well as an internal business process management system that has various kinds of codes and identifiers used in these processes. There have been numerous attempts to make sense and best use of all of this internal information over time, and the pylinkedcmd is just one more bit of that work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores a set of functionality added to pylinkedcmd to help establish linkages from ScienceBase Directory person records to corresponding WikiData entities based on ORCID, which we can then exploit for further linked data coming from other sources developed through WikiData pathways. The motivation for this is an exercise in corporate capacity assessment we are just about to initiate where we wanted to build an algorithm to automatically assemble as much of an individual scientist's research record as possible to serve as context for survey responses. We know, anectodally, that no one accessible source of cataloged information has everything that any of us have contributed to. Official publication records, both journal articles and USGS reports, are mostly well cared for in the USGS Publications Warehouse, but they don't necessarily have everything for everyone and certainly not extending beyond USGS employment. ScienceBase and the USGS Science Data Catalog will have a lot of official data release items, but there will again be missing pieces. We haven't yet made solid connections to tap software control sources like GitHub, and our internal software control systems are less accessible to bot actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring instances of human in WikiData with ORCIDs and indicating USGS employment was illuminating. There are lots of us with records in WikiData that have come together from a variety of databasing mechanisms that are constantly operating against WikiData. So, establishing a reasonably assured linkage to WikiData identities from ScienceBase Directory identities gives us a basis for exploring further exploitation of that resource pool. This notebook was used to run an initial baseline process and serves as an example for how some of pylinkedcmd can be used."
