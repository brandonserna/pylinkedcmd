    "Unfortunately, there is also no way of programmatically getting at the information that USGS staff have put together for their profile pages, so I had to come up with a scraper for that information. I put this into a single function that operates against a given staff profile URL and am currently limiting the work to anything that we can't get from other sources. The interesting bits include a set of keywords, drawn from the USGS Thesaurus, that represent self-assertions of expertise. The other main section that an individual can control themselves is a big body of HTML. We might be able to work through this content with further processing, but for now, I shove that into a string and extract all of the links from it in a list. The links often include publications that are not otherwise part of the listing coming from official channels, which can be a very useful addendum to a research record.\n",
